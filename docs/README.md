## EHR Functions

> A library of useful EHR related functions.

## About

This is a library of useful EHR functions for use within Python, especially when using Jupyter notebooks.

When utilizing Jupyter notebooks for processing data and training models I found myself copying the same code between notebooks.  This code consisted of steps to split my data, create a model, compute some metrics, etc.; and thus the notebooks became very long with little focus on the actual analysis.  Therefore, this set of functions were created to allow for a focus on analysis and to abstract away the process of cleaning data and running models.

The documentation is still being written out so a lot of sections are left blank.
